# Changelog

## [0.12.1] - 2026-08-19

Published from the [wolkwork/obstore](https://github.com/wolkwork/obstore) fork as
`obstore-databaas` on PyPI while the `RemoteSignedS3Store` contribution is under review
upstream. The import name is unchanged, so this is a drop-in replacement for `obstore`.

### New Features :magic_wand:

- Add `RemoteSignedS3Store`, an S3-compatible store that never receives S3 credentials
  and instead has every S3 REST request signed by a Python callback immediately before
  the request is dispatched. This suits catalogs that vend signatures rather than
  credentials, such as Lakekeeper's S3 request signer. Ranged `GET`, `HEAD`, `PUT`
  (including conditional create/update, attributes and tags), `DELETE`, server-side
  `COPY`, `LIST` and multipart uploads are supported, and every retry is signed afresh.
  `RemoteSignedS3Store.from_s3_url(location, signer, endpoint=...)` builds a store from an
  `s3://bucket/prefix` location plus the endpoint serving it, which is how catalogs
  usually report a location.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/developmentseed/obstore/compare/py-v0.8.0...py-v0.8.1

## [0.8.0] - 2025-08-07

### What's Changed

- **Breaking:** Don't double percent-encode paths by @kylebarron in https://github.com/developmentseed/obstore/pull/524
  - This changes the internals from using [`Path` "encoding"](https://docs.rs/object_store/latest/object_store/path/struct.Path.html#encode) to [`Path` "parsing"](https://docs.rs/object_store/latest/object_store/path/struct.Path.html#parse). This avoids issues where paths could be unintentionally double-encoded. But this means that the user must ensure that paths are valid.

## [0.6.0] - 2025-03-24

### New Features :magic_wand:

- Planetary computer credential provider by @kylebarron in https://github.com/developmentseed/obstore/pull/379

### Breaking changes :wrench:

#### Object store methods

No breaking changes.

#### Store constructors

- In the `AzureStore` constructor, the `container` positional argument was renamed to `container_name` to match the `container_name` key in `AzureConfig`. by @kylebarron in https://github.com/developmentseed/obstore/pull/380

  This is a breaking change if you had been calling `AzureStore(container="my container name")`.

  This is **not** breaking if you had been using it as a positional argument `AzureStore("my container name")` or if you had already been using `AzureStore(container_name="my container name")`.

  The idea here is that we want one and only one argument name for each underlying config parameter. Most of these breaking changes took place in 0.5.0, but this was overlooked.

### Bug fixes :bug:

- Fix import errors on Python 3.9:
  - Fix azure auth import on Python 3.9 by @kylebarron in https://github.com/developmentseed/obstore/pull/378
  - Fix `_buffered.pyi` for python 3.9 by @kylebarron in https://github.com/developmentseed/obstore/pull/381

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/developmentseed/obstore/compare/py-v0.5.0...py-v0.5.1

## [0.5.0] - 2025-03-17

### New Features :magic_wand:

- pyo3-bytes slicing by @jessekrubin in https://github.com/developmentseed/obstore/pull/249

### Breaking changes :wrench:

#### Object store methods

No breaking changes.

#### Store constructors

- Removed `S3Store.from_session` and `S3Store._from_native`. Use credential providers instead.
- Reduce the config variations supported for input. I.e. we previously allowed `region`, `aws_region`, `REGION` or `AWS_REGION` as a config parameter to `S3Store`, which could make it confusing. We now only support a single config input value for each underlying concept. https://github.com/developmentseed/obstore/pull/323

#### Fsspec

- Rename `AsyncFsspecStore` to `FsspecStore` by @kylebarron in https://github.com/developmentseed/obstore/pull/297

- **Support for pickling** & always manage store prefix by @kylebarron in https://github.com/developmentseed/obstore/pull/185, https://github.com/developmentseed/obstore/pull/239, https://github.com/developmentseed/obstore/pull/223
- **Add top-level `obstore.store.from_url` function**, which delegates to each store's `from_url` constructor by @kylebarron in https://github.com/developmentseed/obstore/pull/179, https://github.com/developmentseed/obstore/pull/201
- Add option to return Arrow from `list_with_delimiter` by @kylebarron in https://github.com/developmentseed/obstore/pull/238, https://github.com/developmentseed/obstore/pull/244

- Add `__repr__` to `Bytes` class by @jessekrubin in https://github.com/developmentseed/obstore/pull/173

### Breaking changes :wrench:

- `get_range`, `get_range_async`, `get_ranges`, and `get_ranges_async` now require named parameters for `start`, `end`, and `length` to make the semantics of the range request fully explicit. by @kylebarron in https://github.com/developmentseed/obstore/pull/156
- Previously, individual stores did not manage a prefix path within the remote resource and [`PrefixStore`](https://developmentseed.org/obstore/v0.3.0/api/store/middleware/#obstore.store.PrefixStore) was used to enable this. As of 0.4.0, `PrefixStore` was removed and all stores manage an optional mount prefix natively.
- `obstore.open` has been renamed to `obstore.open_reader`.
- The `from_env` constructor has been removed from `S3Store`, `GCSStore`, and `AzureStore`. Now all constructors will read from environment variables. Use `__init__` or `from_url` instead. https://github.com/developmentseed/obstore/pull/189
- `obstore.exceptions.ObstoreError` renamed to `obstore.exceptions.BaseError` https://github.com/developmentseed/obstore/pull/200

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/developmentseed/obstore/compare/py-v0.3.0...py-v0.4.0

## [0.3.0] - 2025-01-16

### New Features :magic_wand:

- **Streaming uploads**. `obstore.put` now supports iterable input, and `obstore.put_async` now supports async iterable input. This means you can pass the output of `obstore.get_async` directly into `obstore.put_async`. by @kylebarron in https://github.com/developmentseed/obstore/pull/54
- **Allow passing config options directly** as keyword arguments. Previously, you had to pass all options as a `dict` into the `config` parameter. Now you can pass the elements directly to the store constructor. by @kylebarron in https://github.com/developmentseed/obstore/pull/144
- **Readable file-like objects**. Open a readable file-like object with `obstore.open` and `obstore.open_async`. by @kylebarron in https://github.com/developmentseed/obstore/pull/33
- **Fsspec integration** by @martindurant in https://github.com/developmentseed/obstore/pull/63
- Prefix store by @kylebarron in https://github.com/developmentseed/obstore/pull/117
- Python 3.13 wheels by @kylebarron in https://github.com/developmentseed/obstore/pull/95
- Support python timedelta objects as duration config values by @kylebarron in https://github.com/developmentseed/obstore/pull/146
- Add class constructors for store builders. Each store now has an `__init__` method, for easier construction. by @kylebarron in https://github.com/developmentseed/obstore/pull/141

### Breaking changes :wrench:

- `get_range`, `get_range_async`, `get_ranges`, and `get_ranges_async` now use **start/end** instead of **offset/length**. This is for consistency with the `range` option of `obstore.get`. by @kylebarron in https://github.com/developmentseed/obstore/pull/71

* Return `Bytes` from `GetResult.bytes()` by @kylebarron in https://github.com/developmentseed/obstore/pull/134

## [0.2.0] - 2024-10-25

### What's Changed

- Streaming list results. `list` now returns an async or sync generator. by @kylebarron in https://github.com/developmentseed/obstore/pull/35
- Optionally return list result as arrow. The `return_arrow` keyword argument returns chunks from `list` as Arrow RecordBatches, which is faster than materializing Python dicts/lists. by @kylebarron in https://github.com/developmentseed/obstore/pull/38
- Return buffer protocol object from `get_range` and `get_ranges`. Enables zero-copy data exchange from Rust into Python. by @kylebarron in https://github.com/developmentseed/obstore/pull/39
- Add put options. Enables custom tags and attributes, as well as "put if not exists". by @kylebarron in https://github.com/developmentseed/obstore/pull/50
- Rename to obstore by @kylebarron in https://github.com/developmentseed/obstore/pull/45
- Add custom exceptions. by @kylebarron in https://github.com/developmentseed/obstore/pull/48
